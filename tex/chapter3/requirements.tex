\section{Requirements}

This project's goal is to produce a software platform that is capable of powering a reference hardware platform based on retail components providing audio, some mobile phone integration, and navigation functionality to an automobile.

\subsection{Graphical Display}

The project should display its system state via a Graphical User Interface.

\subsection{4-channel Audio Support}

The project should be able to output digital audio in four independent channels, all configurable by the operating system.

\subsection{Audio Playback Support}

The project should be able to decode for playback the most common formats of multimedia documents, especially MP3, m4a (Unprotected MPEG-4 AAC audio), and FLAC (Free Lossless Audio).
The project should also include the capacity to add decode support for new formats in the future, as long as the underlying hardware can decode the information in real time.

\subsection{Arbitrary Execution}

The device should be capable of executing any properly built and installed programs desired by the user.
The user will only need a software development kit (SDK) including a compiler for the specific device's architecture and the development resources such as libraries and headers.

\subsection{Remote Administration}

The project should be capable of remote administration on any desired, capable network interface.
No physical manipulation of the target device should be required in order to change most internal settings and perform over-the-air software updates.

\subsection{Personal Media Device Support}

The project should interface with personal media devices available to the underlying operating system.
The solution presented in this project will support USB-connected devices which provide a USB Mass Storage device and a readable filesystem to the host system.

\subsection{Bluetooth Integration}

The project should support wireless networking over the Bluetooth protocol.
This protocol will allow users to link the device with mobile phones in order to provide call and messaging notification.

\subsection{GPS Navigation}

The project should support geolocation if a GPS device is installed.
